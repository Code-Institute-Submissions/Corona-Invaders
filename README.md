Corona Invaders Game
---------------------------------------
**Interactive-frontend-project - Marjolein van Leeuwen**

This is my Interactive Front-end Development project. I created my own Corona Invaders game which is inspired by the original game of Space Invaders ,created by Tomohiro Nishikado in 1978.

**User stories**

* As a user : As a new visitor to the game I want the page to be easily navigated.
* As a user: As a new visitor I want clear instructions on how to play the game.
* As a user: I want a game that responds quickly to my interaction.
* As a User: I want a game that is fun and exciting to play

The ideal user:
* Age 4+
* Children


**Strategy**

* My Goal is to design a Corona Space Invaders game that is fun and easy for users to play. 
The page will be simplistic and easy to navigate around. Its purpose is to make the user happy and strengthen spacial skills.

**Scope**

This page is to provide users with quick access to the Corona Space Invaders game. The Game is to challenge the users to defeat the corona space microbes.

**How to play**
Press the Start game button and the game container will appear. 
Wait for the game to begin. The user can see the Corona space microbes move from left to right.
The challenge is to shoot all 8 Corona space microbes.

**Structure**

* The game buttons are displayed on a black galaxy background. 
* Two options are presented to the user, “Start Game” and “How to Play”. 
* The start game button triggers the game container to bounce down. 
* Eight Corona space microbes and a spaceship appear. 
* By pressing the above arrow you can shoot the Corona space microbes.
* When you defeat all eight corona space microbes, “YOU WIN!”


**Skeleton** 

I created a wireframe using the program “Mockflow”.

**Surface**

* For the surface plane I wanted the design to set in space. 
* My background design was inspired by the Galaxy.
* I used space assets and corona cartoons in my game

**Technologies**

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Javascript

**Deployment**

This project was developed using GitHub.

I followed the next steps to deploy my game on the GitHub pages:

* Log into GitHub.
* Select Sweetzia/Space-Invaders in the repository list.
* Go to Settings
* Scroll down to the GitHub Pages section.
* Select the Master Branch
* On selecting Master Branch the page is automatically refreshed, the game is deployed.
* The link can be retrieved to the deployed website.

**Credits**

* Media: I downloaded space assets on the website [kenney.com][1] ( a free game assets website).
* I downloaded free Corona virus microbes images from Pngtree.com

**Acknowledgements**

*I got inspiration from:*
* The Space Invaders game 

*I used HTML, CSS and JS codes from these sources and edited it for my Corona Space Invaders Game:*

* Code from the youtube tutorial from [Coding Dojo][1] about “ how to build a Space Invaders Game using only HTML, CSS & Javascript*


***I want to thank my mentor Brian Macharia for guiding me through the process of creating my own game inspired by Space Invaders.***
